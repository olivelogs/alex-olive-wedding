[See the live site here!](https://olivelogs.github.io/alex-olive-wedding/ "Alex & Olive Wedding").  

This is just a little personal project. I did not want to pay for a wedding website so I made one to practice CSS & HTML.  

The art is also mine!  

<!--10-19-25 i tried animations, for funsies. working on getting the timing of the graphics & the hero sections to line up appropriately. right now the hero section fades in after the graphics do. how to "blend" the fade-in?-->
